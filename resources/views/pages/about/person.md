# ME AS <span class="color-green">VINCENZO</span> {.title}
## Learn about me as a person {.subtitle}

<hr>

My name is __Vincent__. I was born in 1998 in a small town in Sicily, Italy.

What to say about me? I'm __passionate__ about what I do.
I've got __objectives__ in mind and
I'm aware about my path.
Something that I like about me it's that I've always known what
I wanted to do. Since when I was young
I had a strong passion for __Information Technology__.

This helped me to get some money before my eighteen birthday,
then, I was able to leave my family to go to live by myself.
It was the first time for me and I had a little idea about what to do.
In the end, I was successful.
After a bit I've learned how to keep my house in __order__,
how to cook for myself and
how to take my __responsibilities__.

I love to __organize__ my time, __plan__ the weeks and __define__ quarterly goals.
I've got __objectives__ that I want to __achieve__.

### Organization and planning

Sometimes I like to go randomly and see what is going to happen.
On the other hand, mostly of the time, I'm always __organized__.
Having a plan helps me to understand what are my objectives and
how to __chose__ between my activities.
This is very useful when thinking about my long term goals.

### Goals

I strongly believe in __minimalism__ to fulfil my life.
A little, well-defined, __ambitious__ objectives are
more valuable than a lot of them.
Right now, I'm doing my best to advance in my __career__ and to __grow__ as a person.
I've got a lot of things in my mind, and a lot of activities that
I would like to start.

### Learning

For me, growing up is strictly correlated to learning.
Learning as a __tool__ to discover.
Discover places, people, technologies, activities, books...
I love to know new things.
It helps me to get new __ideas__,
to open new paths for __opportunities__ and
to try new __experiences__.

### Everyday life

I'm very __open-minded__,
I like to know about what is __different__ from me,
I don't have __preconceptions__ and if
I have something to say you will know about it.
Of course, I've got my own ideas and my experiences, so
I'm aware about what I could like and what I couldn't.
I define myself as an __intellectual__.
Sometimes I think too much, but generally speaking,
I'm always looking for a way to understand what's going on.
There's always a reason if something is happening.
