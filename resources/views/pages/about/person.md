## Learn about me as a person {.subtitle}

<hr>

My name is __Vincent__. I was born in 1998 in a small town in Sicily, Italy.

What to say about me? I'm __passionate__ about what I do. I've got __objectives__ in mind and
I'm aware about my path.
As you might know, life isn't easy, but I consider myself lucky because I've always known what
I wanted to do. Since when I was young I had a strong passion for __Information Technology__.

This helped me to get some money before my eighteen birthday, then, I was able to leave my family to go to
live by myself. At first, it was hard. It was the first time for me and I had a little idea about what to do.
But in the end, I was successful. After a bit I've learned how to keep my house in __order__, how to cook for
myself and how to take my own __responsibilities__. When you're on your own, nobody is going to
pay the bills for you. It was a very good chance to grow up and become a man.

Something that helped me a lot during this period was reading about __personal growth__. __Organize__ your time,
__plan__ your days, __define__ objectives and __change__ your habits to __achieve__ your goals.

### Organization and planning

Sometimes I like to go randomly and see what is going to happen. On the other hand, mostly of the time, I'm
always organized. Having a plan helps me to understand what are my objectives and how to __chose__ between
my activities. This is very useful when thinking about my long term goals.

### Goals

I strongly believe in __minimalism__ to fulfil my life. A little, well-defined, __ambitious__ objectives are more
valuable than a lot of them. Right now, I'm doing my best to advance in my career and to grow as a person.
I've got a lot of things in my mind, and a lot of activities that I would like to start. This is why I want
to find a financial __stability__ first.

### Learning

I think that growing up is strictly correlated to learning. I'm not talking about learning subjects at school.
I'm talking about learning as a __tool__ to discover. Discover places, people, technologies, activities, books...
I love to know new things. It helps me to get new __ideas__, to open new paths for __opportunities__ and
to try new __experiences__.

### Everyday life

This section could keep me busy for several hours. In a few words, I'm very __open-minded__, I like to know
about what is __different__ from me, I don't have __preconceptions__ and if I have something to say
you will know about it. Of course, I've got my ideas and my experiences, so I'm aware about what I could
like and what I won't. To finish, I'm a __tinker__. Sometimes I think too much, but generally speaking, I'm
always looking for a way to understand what's going on. There's always a reason if something is happening.
