    I love <strong>Mixed Martial Arts</strong>. I've been practising since when I was sixteen and today I can say that
    I'm a good fighter. Even if I take my preparation very seriously and I've dreamed about fighting in a cage I've
    never had a competitive fight. I've got other objectives in mind, but I will still continue to practice
    <strong>MMA</strong> and fitness in general.

    I still remember how excited I was during my first solo trip. It was in <strong>Amsterdam</strong> and I remember
    it was the best experience that I've ever had during the first year after leaving home. By coming back I knew
    that travelling would have taken a good part in my life. As of today I've been in <strong>The Netherlands</strong>,
    <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>Romania</strong>. Of course, I've visited some places in my home country:
    <strong>Italy</strong>.

    <strong>Reading</strong> is also something that I'm into. Where did I get most of my knowledge? Yep, books. I love
    to read about personal growth and how we humans work. Sometimes I like to read something relaxed, but only if it's
    in <strong>English</strong> language.
</p>

    For a short period I've also been a <strong>dancer</strong>. During those six months I've learned mostly
    of the basics and some intermediate move in salsa and bachata. I really liked to move my body and to knew different
    kind of people, but I dropped since I haven't got too much time.
