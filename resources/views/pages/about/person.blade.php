    Hi, I'm <strong>Ma</strong>rragony <strong>Vin</strong>cenzo. I'm 20, I was born in Sicily and I'm currently
    looking for a new place where to stay.
</p>

<p>
    I left home when I was eighteen and right now I'm living by myself. It was hard at first, but this time has
    taught me a lot of things about life. I've learned to face problems, to take my own
    <strong>responsibilities</strong>, to <strong>care</strong> about myself and the place where
    I live, to pay bills and expenses in time and many other things that a solo man has to do.
</p>

<p>
    Something that helped me a lot was reading about <strong>personal growth</strong>. I've started to plan my days,
    define <strong>objectives</strong> and change my <strong>habits</strong> to achieve them.
    I've learned how to talk better, how to manage my <strong>time</strong> and how to say no.
    My career path in information technology makes me happy about what I do.
    Programming has helped me to change my mindset
    in a way where I'm not scared any more about facing problems and unexpected events. Keep calm, think and act is my
    new motto.
</p>

<p>
    In my everyday life I'm very friendly and <strong>open-minded</strong>. I think that everyone is free to live
    as he wants until there's respect for each other. We're a lot in this world, there are different cultures
    and life styles. I'm just curious to discover them all.
