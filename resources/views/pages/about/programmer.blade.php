<p>
    My nickname is Mavin,
    <strong>3 years</strong> of experience in information technology fields.
</p>

<p>
    I'm very experienced in <strong>php</strong> programming and I love <strong>Laravel Framework</strong>.
    Through the years I've mastered my fluency in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> by both
    studying and applying what I've learned day by day. As you might image, I've also got a solid knowledge about
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> language. My experience in building navigable <strong>user interfaces</strong>,
    <strong>responsive</strong> layouts and <strong>search engine optimized</strong> websites let me craft
    valuable applications.
</p>

<p>
    My job isn't just about programming a <strong>back-end</strong> application or presenting a
    <strong>front-end</strong> one. I'm also a specialized <strong>system administration</strong>.
    During the last years, by becoming a GNU/Linux user, I had the pleasure to live with
    many unexpected behaviours and problems. This led me to discover new
    troubleshooting techniques and to explore new applications and practices. I struggled with
    <strong>protocols</strong>, <strong>web servers</strong>, <strong>database applications</strong>,
    <strong>backup management</strong>, <strong>caching methods</strong> and many other technologies.
    Today I'm able to maintain a multipurpose server by myself.
</p>

<p>
    My strength comes with experience and versatility. I've started the specialized path in
    <strong>web developing</strong> during the last years. Before I've learned desktop programming and scripting
    languages such as <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>,
    <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>LUA</strong>. I'm also passionate
    about <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>networking</strong>.
