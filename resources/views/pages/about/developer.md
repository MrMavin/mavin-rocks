# ME AS <span class="color-red">MAVIN</span> {.title}
## Learn about my experience as a developer {.subtitle}

<hr>

Everything started when I was __twelve__,
during my middle school period.
I've started by writing a simple desktop application
in __Visual Basic.NET__.
I don't remember what was the goal of that project,
but it marked the start of my path.
Since then, I've decided that I wanted to go deeper about programming.

My nickname is __Mavin__, the shorthand for __Ma__rragony __Vin__cenzo.
As today, I've got __three__ years of experience in full stack web development.
My knowledge is divided between __system administration__,
__back-end programming__ and __front-end designing__.

### System Administration

I've started by configuring a small __raspberry pi 3__,
hosted in my own house.
At first, I needed to manage a single hard disk to store my data.
Then I've enabled encryption, a web server, a self-hosted paste-bin
like utility and a server monitor.

After the first successful attempt, I've started to configure some bigger servers
to host my personal applications and services.
I've discovered that I really liked to configure server infrastructures
to provide high quality services.

Switching to __GNU/Linux__ for my everyday life was the best choice that
I've ever done. I'm a __Fedora__ user since five years now.

### Back-end programming

At some point I've started to ask myself: how was this website made?
Then, I've started to read some articles about __web developing__.
After discovering __php__, I've immediately started to experiment with it.
Fortunately I had some background experience in programming, it was pretty easy.

Later I've discovered __Laravel Framework__.
I really liked the project, so I've started to master it.
All the concepts about dependency injection, auto-loading and
package management were all available in one single toolbox.
Without considering all the services and features available out of the box.
This framework helped me a lot to speed up my development process.

### Front-end programming

Here, my knowledge fluctuate between __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JavaScript__.
Currently I'm mastering the latest ES6
features and I'm experimenting using __React__ framework.

Being a user myself, I know how it is important to provide a clean,
easy to navigate and responsive interface.
This is why I'm always looking for new paths to improve my design skills.

Unfortunately, I'm not a visual designer, illustrator or an artist.
I would like to learn, but it's not an important goal to follow right now.
Give me a design, and I will be more than happy to make a __web page__ out of it!
