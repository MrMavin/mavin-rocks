## How do I spend my free time? {.subtitle}

<hr>

I like to be active during my free time.
Even if sometimes I like to watch something on Netflix,
I usually like to go for a walk or read a book.
I'm a __sportsman__, __traveller__ and __reader__.

### Mixed Martial Arts

This is my sport. It's three years since when I started and
I don't regret a single injury.
The reason behind this choice was about my lack of confidence.
This sport taught me a lot about __respect__ and __pain__.
I'm mastering my ability to fight, just to avoid it in the public place.
I've understood the risks involved in a physical argument,
knowledge that made me more responsible about my actions.
But the most important thing, is that I've discovered
how important is to put your heart to achieve your desired skills.
As we, athletes in general, say:

> No pain, no gain

### Other sports

I love the bicycle. In the past it helped me to lose weight,
then it was just love to pedal and go beyond your limits.

When I was young I did five years of swimming,
half a year of basket and some skating.
I've also been to the gym, but I don't like it.

### Travels

It's not too much that I've started to travel,
and my view about it has changed through time.
The first place that I've been to was __Amsterdam, Netherlands__.
It was not just my first travel, it was my first solo travel.
I really liked the city, the bicycles and __Vondelpark__.
People are also amazing there, and almost every supermarket has got donuts!

My second European city was __Berlin, Germany__.
I stayed there for just four days.
During this time I was able to visit all the city centre.
It was a pretty "normal" travel: wake up, walk, eat, visit, eat,
walk again, eat, sleep.

Then, I've changed my way of travelling.
I've decided that I want to experience the life abroad like a local.
This is why my next travel to __Bucharest, Romania__ is two months long.
Indeed, I'm writing this text while I'm here.
The first month is gone. To be honest, I'm enjoying this place.
Maybe it's the big city, maybe it's the summer, but I'm having a good time here.

My next monthly trip will be in __Warsaw, Poland__.
I will for sure update this section to let you know how it ended up.

### Reading

Where did I get most of my knowledge? Books, guides and articles.
I love to read about personal growth and how we humans work.
Sometimes I like to read something relaxed, maybe a story or an adventure,
with a strict rule to read only if it's in __English__ language.
That's a good way to master the foreign language.
